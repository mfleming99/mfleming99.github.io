			<h1> 
				<p class="font-weight-light">Introduction </p>

			<p> Hi, I'm Max Fleming, a Computer Science and Computer Engineering Student
			at Johns Hopkins.

				<p class="font-weight-light">Drink Dispencer - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhGYPPGSpDU" target="_blank">Video Link</a></p>
			</h3>
			<p>
			<p> This robot dispences drinks based off of users voice input. I used an app called Android Meets Robot, made by ____. The Android meets
			Robot app prossesses the speech into text, and sends it to the bluetooth reciever I put in the drink dipenser. The bluetooth reciever then sends the text to the
			arduino clone. The arduino clone can prosseess the text and then decide what to do. There we a couple diffrent commands that the 
			user could tell the robot. In the video I said, "Make me a drink." which dispences 1.5oz of the red fluid and 4.5 oz of the green fluid.
			To make this robot better, I could have used a voice recognition hardware-based speech recognition
			module, so I wouldn't have to use a phone. I also would have used more powerful
			motors, as the motors were only capable of pumping 3oz a minute.</p>
